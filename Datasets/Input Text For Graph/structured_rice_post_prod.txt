The plant should be cut close to the ground at ripening and left for drying. Threshing can be accomplished by manual methods, pedal threshers or power driven stationary threshers. Combine machines can be employed for combined harvesting and threshing. The produce should be properly sun-dried. The optimum moisture content for storage of rice grains is 12%. A well managed crop of mid-late duration (135-150 days) varieties and hybrids yield about 6–7 t/ha, whereas short duration cultivars yield about 4.5–5.5 t/ha.

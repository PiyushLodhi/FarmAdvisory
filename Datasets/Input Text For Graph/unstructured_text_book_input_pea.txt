Pea (Pisum sativum L.) is an important pulse crop in India. 
There are two types of cultivated pea i.e. gardenpea (Pisum sativum var. hartamse) and fieldpea (Pisum sativum var. aliense). 
The field pea is generally grown for dry seeds, which are used for a variety of snack preparations and dal. 
The mature pea is highly nutritive containing high proportion of digestive proteins (22.5%), carbohydrates (62.1%), fats (1.8%), minerals (calcium, iron) and vitamins (riboflavin, thiamin etc). 
In India, fieldpea occupies an area of 0.62 million ha with an annual production of 0.56 million tonnes. The average productivity is 906 kg/ha. 
The major fieldpea growing states are Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra.
Peas require a cool growing season with moderate temperatures and relatively high humidity. 
Most cultivars have light frost tolerance, however, temperature > 27Â°C adversely affects the crop. 
Peas are most sensitive to moisture stress at flowering stage.
High humidity associated with cloudy weather results into spread of fungal diseases like damping off, powdery mildew etc.
A well-drained sandy-loam or sandy clay loam is required for successful production of peas. 
It prefers soil with pH 6.5-7.

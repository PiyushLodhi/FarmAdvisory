The most suitable stage for harvesting wheat is when plants are completly dry and the grains becomes hard and contain 20-25% moisture. Wheat crop harvested manually or by reapers, is dried for 3-4 days on the threshing floor and then threshing is done by threshers. A well managed crop may yield about 3.5 to 4.5 t grains/ha.

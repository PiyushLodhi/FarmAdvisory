Leaf and neck blast 
Initial symptoms on the leaves are white to grayish green circular lesions/spots with dark green borders, which may enlarge and coalesce to kill the entire leaves. Lesions on the neck cause the girdling of the neck and the panicle to fall over.
Early sowing of seeds and balanced use of fertilizers.
Planting resistant varieties against the rice blast is the most practical and economical way.
Systemic fungicides are effective against the disease.
##
Bacterial leaf blight
Water-soaked to yellowish stripes on leaf blades or
starting at leaf tips. 
Severely infected leaves tend to dry quickly.
Field sanitation such as removing weed hosts, rice straws, ratoons, and volunteer seedlings.
Use of resistant varieties.
Seed treatment with bleaching powder (100Î¼g/ml) and zinc sulfate (2%) reduce bacterial blight.

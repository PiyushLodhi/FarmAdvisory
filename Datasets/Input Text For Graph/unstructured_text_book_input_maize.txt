Maize ( Zea mays L ) is one of the most versatile emerging crops having wider adaptability under varied agro-climatic conditions. 
It is the only grain crop with many types and grown for diverse purposes like normal yellow/white grain, sweet corn, baby corn, popcorn, quality protein maize (QPM), waxy corn, high amylase corn, high oil corn, fodder maize etc.
Globally , Maize is known as queen of cereals because Maize has the highest genetic yield potential among cereals. 
In India , Maize is the third most important food crops after rice and wheat. 
According to latest data of 2011-12, Maize is cultivated in 8.78 m ha mainly during Kharif season which covers 80% area.
Predominant maize growing states collectively contributing to more than 80% of total national maize production are Andhra Pradesh (20.9%), Karnataka (16.5%), Rajasthan (9.9%), Maharashtra (9.1%), Bihar (8.9%), Uttar Pradesh (6.1%), Madhya Pradesh (5.7%) and Himachal Pradesh (4.4%).
Maize is grown globally from 50°N to 40°S, and from sea level up to 4000 m altitude.
Maize crop requires good amount of moisture and can be grown in areas receiving well distributed rainfall of 500 to 1000 mm. 
It uses water more efficiently and relatively drought resistant from establishment to tasseling stage of the crop where it can stands with less moisture. 
Maize is relatively well adapted to a wide range of soils with pH
5.0 to 8.0. 
Maize can be grown successfully in a variety of soils, ranging from loamy-sand to clay-loam. 
Being a sensitive crop to excess soil moisture; it is desirable to have provision of proper drainage in maize.
Generally, the raised bed planting is considered as best planting method for maize

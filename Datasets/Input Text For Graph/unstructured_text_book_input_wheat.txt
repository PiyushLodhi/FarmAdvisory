Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is the main Rabi cereal crop in India. 
The total area under the crop is about 29.8 million ha in the country. 
The production of wheat in the country has increased to an all time record high of 94.88 million MT in 2011-12. 
The productivity of wheat is 3140 kg/ha in 2011-12.
Wheat is grown over a wide range of latitudes ranging between 60 o N and 60 o S and altitudes ranging from sea level to 3500 m amsl in the tropics and subtropics. 
Normally, the most ideal conditions for wheat cultivation are cool and moist weather during the
vegetative growth period and warm and dry weather during grain formation. 
The optimum temperature for the germination of wheat is between 20-22 o C, though wheat grain can
also germinate at 4 o C. 
The optimum temperature for vegetative growth ranges from 16
to 22 o C. 
During the grain development, wheat requires a mean maximum temperature of about 25 o C for at least four to five weeks. Wheat grows well in those areas where annual rainfall ranges between 250 and 1800 mm. 
Wheat crop also cannot withstand extended periods of soil moisture stress. 
Rainfed wheat requires a minimum evenly distributed winter rainfall of 15 to 20 cm. 
Wheat is grown on a wide variety of soils.
Under irrigated timely sown condition, wheat sowing may be done in the first fortnight of November in north India and the middle of November in north-east and central India.
Under late sown conditions, the wheat is sown in first fortnight of December. 
Rainfed wheat is generally sown from second fortnight of October to early-November to get maximum benefit from residual soil moisture. 
Seeds can be sown through broadcasting or in lines in rows 20 cm apart. 
Under normal conditions, a seed rate of 100 kg/ha is sufficient. 
Under late sown conditions, seed rate should be increased by 25 per cent.
Irrigated wheat is spaced 22.5 cm between rows and 8-10 cm between plants. 
Rainfed wheat is spaced 25-30 cm between rows and 5-6 cm between plants. 
Seed depth should be around 5 cm.
The general N+P 2 O 5 +K 2 O recommendations for irrigated and rainfed wheat are 120+60+30 kg/ha and 80+40+20 kg/ha, respectively. 
Full dose of phosphorus and potassium and half of nitrogen should be applied at the time of sowing, while remaining half dose should be top dressed in two equal splits one at first irrigation and other at flowering stage. 
Farmyard manure (FYM) or organic manures @ 10 t/ha at the time of sowing is beneficial for long-term fertility maintenance.
Wheat requires about 300-400 cm of irrigation water (4-6 irrigations), depending upon climatic factors, soil characteristics and the duration of the variety. 
If irrigation water is a constraint, then apply irrigation at critical stages.

Berseem (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) is a most important winter forage legume in India.
Berseem is commonly cultivated as winter annual in the tropical and subtropical regions.
Berseem forage contains about 20% crude protein with high digestibility (up to 65%) and palatability.
Berseem is adapted to cool and moderately cold climate.
Berseem can be grown successfully in areas which receive annual rainfall of 150-250 cm or even lower but the irrigation must be assured.
Berseem can be grown on all types of soils except very light sandy soils.
The seeds being very small, berseem requires a fine seedbed.

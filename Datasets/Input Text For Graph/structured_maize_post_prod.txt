The crop acquires physiological maturity when black layer starts forming on the tip of the grains. The crop must be harvested at less than 22 to 25% moisture in grains with husk colour turning pale brown. The harvesting of the cob is done manually. After de-cobbing and threshing, the maize grains must be dried upto 12% moisture level for safe storage. A well managed maize HYVâ€™s and hybrid maize may yield about 4-5 and 5-7 t grains/ha, respectively.

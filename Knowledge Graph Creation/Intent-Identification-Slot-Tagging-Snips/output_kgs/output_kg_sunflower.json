			"Cutworms": "The insect may be serious during March-April in fields where sunflower follows potato. Caterpillars cut the seedlings at the ground level. Apply chlorpyriphos @ 5 L/ha mixed in 10 kg fine soil and broadcasted uniformly before sowing in the field after last ploughing but before planking."

		"postProductionTechnique": "The sunflower crop is ready when back of the head turns yellowish-brown and the moisture in seed is 20%. The harvested heads should be dried well in sun and then threshed manually or using threshers. Further, sun-drying of the seed is desirable before storage or oil. A good crop of sunflower yields about 2 t grains/ha."

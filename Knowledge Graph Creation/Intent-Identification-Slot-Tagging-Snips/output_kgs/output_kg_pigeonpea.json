				"symptom": "During the growing phase, incidence of yellow mosaic can be seen. The affected plants show yellow mottled symptoms. These plants can be rouged out as and when they appear.",
				"management": "White fly is known to spread this disease; hence after removal of the affected plants, an insecticide spray is important."

		"pestManagement": {
			"Pod borer": "Pod borer survives on many host plants across different seasons, including cotton and legumes. Redgram is its preferred choice. Monocrotophos (0.04%) spray at pre and post-flowering stage is effective in controlling this pest."
		},
		"postProductionTechnique": "When most of the leaves are shed and 80% pods turn brown, is the best time for harvest. A grain yield of 15-20 q/ha as rainfed intercrop and 25-30 q/ha as irrigated monocrop can be obtained. Very early and early varieties yield 20-30% less. Dry clean seeds in sun to ensure moisture below 8%. Beetles affect redgram in storage. Mix crushed neem leaves with grain and store in gunny bags. Gunny bags can also be treated with 5% neem oil."

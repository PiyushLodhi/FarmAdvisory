		"postProductionTechnique": "Two harvesting systems are used most widely in coffee growing. Picking: Coffee picking is a totally manual process in which the ripe cherries are selected and picked one-by-one, requiring pickers to rotate through the crop several times. This yields a more uniform high-quality crop. Stripping: Coffee stripping is a process that may be manual or mechanised in which all the fruit is removed in one go when it is of average ripeness. It often requires a further check to eliminate impurities and under-ripe or already fermented cherries.",

			"Coffee berry borer": "The female beetle bores into the berries through the navel region and makes tunnels in the hard bean and lays eggs. A typical pinhole at the tip of the berries indicates the presence of the pest and it damages yound as well as ripe berries. Control measures: Timely andd complete harvest, burying the infested berries and maintaining optimum shade and good drainage can control the pest. Spraying quinalphos 0.05% along with wetting agent 120-150 days after flowering can control the pest.",
			"White stem borer": "The adults have two flight periods as they emerge from the pupae during April-May and in September to December/ January. As the beetles are active and females lay eggs in the crevices on the main stem of coffee. Swabbing the main stem and the thick primaries with carbaryl 50 WP @ 4 kg in 200 L water once or twice in April-May or October to December."

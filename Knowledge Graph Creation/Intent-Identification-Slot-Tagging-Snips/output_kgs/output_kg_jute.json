		"postProductionTechnique": "Jute crop can be harvested from 100 to 110 DAS but can be extended from 120 - 135 DAS depending on local cropping systems. Jute plants are left in the field for 3 - 4 days for leaf shedding. Then thick and thin plants are sorted out and bundled in convenient size. Green plant weight yield is 45-50 t/ha. Fibre yield is 2.0-2.5 t/ha."

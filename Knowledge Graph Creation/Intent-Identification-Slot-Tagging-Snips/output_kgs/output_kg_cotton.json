		"postProductionTechnique": "Cotton is harvested in 3-4 pickings by hand as the bolls mature. By adopting improved technology, it is possible to harvest about 1.5-2 t/ha of seed cotton (kapas). However, much higher yields may be obtained from hybrid cottons. Cotton lint production is 33% of kapas production, while cotton to seed production is 66% of kapas production. Oil to seeds crushed is 14-18% and cake to seeds crushed is 82-86%."

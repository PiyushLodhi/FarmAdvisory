Threshing can be accomplished by manual methods, pedal threshers or power driven stationary threshers. Combine machines can be employed for combined harvesting and threshing. The produce should be properly sun-dried. The optimum moisture content for storage of rice grains is 12%. A well managed crop of mid-late duration (135-150 days) varieties and hybrids yield about 6\u20137 t/ha, whereas short duration cultivars yield about 4.5\u20135.5 t/ha"}}
